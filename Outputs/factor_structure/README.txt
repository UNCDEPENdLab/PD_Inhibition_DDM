factoranalysis_3-27-20: shows results of successive EFAs with all scores (see tabs), using either ml or principle axis factoring

The following pdfs show correlations btwn summary stats for each task and the factor scores from the 9-factor EFA (ml):
flanker_9factor_correlations
gng_9f_correlations
recentprobes_9f_correlations

The following pdfs show correlations btwn summary stats and all self-report scales (MPQ/SNAP):
flanker_sr_correlations
gng_sr_correlations
recentprobes_sr_correlations

roughsketch_factorstructure_3-27-20: shows conceptual hierarchical mapping of scales (mostly from my head, not empirical)

self_report_correlations: intercorrelations among all scales
self_report_histograms: distributions for all scales
