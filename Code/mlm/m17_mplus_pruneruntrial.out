*** WARNING in VARIABLE command
  Note that only the first 8 characters of variable names are used in the output.
  Shorten variable names to avoid any confusion.
*** WARNING in PLOT command
  Note that only the first 8 characters of variable names are used in plots.
  If variable names are not unique within the first 8 characters, problems
  may occur.
*** WARNING

Equivalent model to lmer m17, prune run_trial covariances

*** FATAL ERROR
     THE VARIANCE COVARIANCE MATRIX IS NOT SUPPORTED.
     ONLY FULL VARIANCE COVARIANCE BLOCKS ARE ALLOWED.
     USE ALGORITHM=GIBBS(RW) OR ALGORITHM=MH TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
